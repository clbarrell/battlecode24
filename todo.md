# TODO List of things

In progress:
- use the priority flag thing.

Not started
- Safe passage returning with flag. When I have a flag, put it in shared array and which spawn I'm going to. Then every other duck can make sure that they do not block the path of the flag carrier by whitelisting cells from FlagCarrier to Spawn within 4 cells of the FlagCarrier.


- How do I know where I got the flag from? so I can stop looking there.
- When in jail, find a good spawn location based on other data
- Fill in water cells when blocked!!
- Have squads
- Defend. Make some traps near base. Have a squad build them.
- Keep the flag carriers safe.
- Bug nav: save the direction I was trying to go. Instead of getting Direction.to(dest), just keep trying idealDirection until it's visitable.
- Notify that someone is holding our flag
- Fix the losslessness of after I've picked up the flags
round upgrade thing
retreat if health low

Bot name:
- Duck2
  - First basic bot working. Does all the things. No defense though basically, except for a few traps.
  - Instead of just guessing enemy spawns by my spawn locs, save the location of my flags (3) and use that.
- Duck3
